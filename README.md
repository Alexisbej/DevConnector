# DevConnector 

This is my 1st full stack app that i made with React.js and Node.js, following Brad Traversy's MERN STACK course.

This app is a social network for developers, that allow them to create a profesionnal profile, adding github repositories. There is a conversation part, working as a forum.

The app is pushed on Heroku at : https://devconnector-bejrach.herokuapp.com/

## Node.js API

The API was developed with Node.js using Express.

This is my 1st experience using JS as a backend language, loved it ! In the past, everything I knew about backend was PHP and managing databases with SQL (using phpmyadmin). As I already knew that i loved JS, learning Node was obvious for me. This course was a great firts experience, learnt about routes, models, controllers.. Lot of fun !

## React.js APP

I already knew react before taking this course. I learnt it at school, with O'Clock. Was teached to use react, redux, react-router-dom.. Pretty professionnaly. This course allowed me to manage better the structure of my app. Components are separated with some good logic, reducers too. I improved a lot with Hooks, that i really love because it allow us not to use Class components.

### About me

Im Alexis Bejrach and im 25. I left my job at FREE's technical support in 2017, and fell in love with web development. I followed some courses on openclassrooms then i knew i wanted to do this job every day. With O'Clock school, i had the opportunity to learn all the basis about web development (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, MySql) and prefered frontend. I specialised on JS with React.js and ended my path with a month of building a real app with a team of 4 developers (2 React / 2 Symfony for the API).
Now i continue to work on my knowledge, to become a good web developer, in love of clean code.

I'm now looking for a job in France, and I'm open to opportunities everywhere.
